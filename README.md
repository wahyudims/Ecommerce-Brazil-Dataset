# Ecommerce-Brazil-Dataset
Here I tried to do analysis about Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The analysis consists of product sold analysis, the best time to advertise product, etc. I also try to cluster the customers using RFM analysis into several categories and make a machine learning model which could predict the category of customer based on the clustering that have been made in RFM Analysis

## Context
This dataset is about Ecommerce Store in Brazil. This dataset consists of 7 sub dataset that contain various features from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers.

## Task
Create analysis based on several deep dive question and make a model that could predict the category of the customer

## Data Modelling Outline
The following are a few steps in the modeling technique used on this project:
1. Import Modules/Packages.
2. Import Dataset.
3. Data Cleaning.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
5. RFM Analysis.
6. Data Preprocessing.
7. Prediction Modelling.
8. Conclusion & Recommendation.

## Load the dataset
As mentioned above, the dataset consists of 7 sub datasets. Those 7 sub datasets will be merged into one big dataframe. The final dataframe will consists of total rows of 113,193 rows and 40 columns.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is used to identify data that has a NaN value so that it can be processed further using machine learning modeling. The missing values of dataset orders_dataset and product_dataset are relatively small so we could just get rid of it. But the order_reviews dataset has so many missing values that we couldn't just remove it. So for now we will fill the missing values with 'No Reviews'.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before we jump into the EDA. First we will set several deep dive question.
 * What state does give the most customer?
 * What product is the most sold?
 * What is the average spending of each state?
 * What is the most sold product on each state?
 * What times, days, and month are the orders most occurred?
 * What is the average time of delivery?

Let's jump to each deep dive question.
 
* What state does give the most customer? <br><br>

  According to pareto rule. The object that falls below 80% cut off line are 'vital few' factors that affect selling the most. As we can see the state that gives the most customer are:
  1. SP (Sao Paulo),
  2. RJ (Rio de Janeiro),
  3. MG (Minas Gerais),
  4. RS (Rio Grande do Sul),
  5. PR (Paran√°), 
  6. SC (Santa Catarina). 

  Those states alone contributes to 80% of the customer.
  
* What product is the most sold? <br><br>

  7 of 71 products sold already cover over than 50% of the sales. Those 7 products are:
  1. Bed Bath Table, 
  2. Health Beauty, 
  3. Sports Leisure,
  4. Furniture Decor,
  5. Computers Accessories,
  6. Housewares,
  7. Watches_gifts.

* What is the average spending of each state? <br><br>

  Paraiba has the highest average spending value, Sao Paulo on the other hand lies on the other end of the same spectrum.

* What is the most sold product on each state?

  The most sold furnitures across each state are bed bath table, furniture decor, health beauty, and sports leisure. Bed bath table dominate the sales on top 5 states which are SP, RJ, MG, RS, and PR.
  
* What times, days, and month are the orders most occurred?
